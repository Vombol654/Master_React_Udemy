1.Building single page application with vanila javascript?
Ans: frontend web appication is all about handeling data and displaying it to the user. ui always needs to stay sync with updated data(data<->ui).it is a very hard task to do. If we want to build a complex app with simple javascript we have to do so much DOM Manipulation and traversing. Data(state) stored in DOM and working with state may create lot of bugs. frontend framework helps to keep ui in sync with data and it also helps to write a structural code.
